# Depression Screening for Veterans

## Overview
Users will create a profile using their email. Upon registration, they are required to provide FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, GENDER, E-MAIL, DOB, and ZIP CODE. Once registered, they can complete the PHQ-9.

### PHQ-9
The PHQ-9 is a diagnostic tool used for assessing and measuring depression severity. It consists of nine items, each scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), reflecting symptoms experienced over the past two weeks. Scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Moderate scores (>=10) are considered POSITIVE, while scores below 10 are NEGATIVE.
